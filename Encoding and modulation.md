   1. Unipolar signaling

      Uses only one polarity (e.g., 0 V and +V).
      Simple, but inefficient (no negative voltages used).
      Example: Unipolar NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero).
    
    2. Polar signaling
    
      Uses two polarities (e.g., -V and +V).
      More efficient, average voltage closer to 0.
      Example: Polar NRZ or Manchester coding.
    
    3. Data rate
    
      Number of bits transmitted per second (bps).
      
      Formula:
      𝑅𝑏 = 1/𝑇𝑏
    	
    
    4. Duration (or length) of a bit
    
      The time to send 1 bit.
      
      Formula:
      𝑇𝑏 = 1/𝑅𝑏
   
    5. Encoding
      Encoding takes a digital or an analog signal and
      converts it to a form suitable for sending on a wire or
      a fibre

    6. Modulation
      Modulation takes a digital or an analog signal and
      modifies a carrier signal with it

    7. Modulation rate
       Modulation rate = Baud rate
   
    8. Mark and Space
       Binary 1 and 0 respectively

✅ In short:
Unipolar → only positive voltages.
Polar → both positive & negative voltages.
Data rate = bits per second.
Bit duration = inverse of data rate.
