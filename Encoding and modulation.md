# Encoding techniques

1. Digital data, Digital signal

Terms
```
1. Unipolar signaling

 Uses only one polarity (e.g., 0 V and +V).
 Simple, but inefficient (no negative voltages used).
 Example: Unipolar NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero).

2. Polar signaling

 Uses two polarities (e.g., -V and +V).
 More efficient, average voltage closer to 0.
 Example: Polar NRZ or Manchester coding.

3. Data rate

 Number of bits transmitted per second (bps).
 
 Formula:
 ùëÖùëè = 1/ùëáùëè


4. Duration (or length) of a bit

 The time to send 1 bit.
 
 Formula:
 ùëáùëè = 1/ùëÖùëè

5. Encoding
 Encoding takes a digital or an analog signal and
 converts it to a form suitable for sending on a wire or
 a fibre

6. Modulation
 Modulation takes a digital or an analog signal and
 modifies a carrier signal with it

7. Modulation rate
  Modulation rate = Baud rate

8. Mark and Space
  Binary 1 and 0 respectively  
```

```
‚úÖ In short:
Unipolar ‚Üí only positive voltages.
Polar ‚Üí both positive & negative voltages.
Data rate = bits per second.
Bit duration = inverse of data rate.
```

## Baseband VS Broadband
```
1. Baseband

Uses the entire channel bandwidth to send a single signal.
Signal type: Digital (square wave, pulses).
Transmission: One signal at a time.
Range: Short-distance (LAN, Ethernet).
Example: Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), USB.

2. Broadband

Divides the available bandwidth into multiple channels using modulation.
Signal type: Analog (modulated carriers).
Transmission: Multiple signals simultaneously.
Range: Long-distance (WAN, cable TV, Internet).
Example: Cable TV, DSL, 4G/5G.
```

## Interpreting Signals
```
Need to know - 
1. Timing of bits - when they start and end
2. Signal levels

Factors affecting successful interpreting of signals
* Signal to noise ratio
* Data rate
* Bandwidth
```
## NRZ

1. Nonreturn to Zero-level (NRZ-L)

```
* Two different voltages for 0 and 1
* Never stay in zero so we get plus and minus values to map 1 and 0. (ex : +5V for 1 and -5V for 0)
* Stay at the level between the bit interval
```  
3.  Nonreturn to Zero Inverted (NRZ-I) - (Differential encoding)

   * Transition (0to1 or 1to0) denotes a binary 1 .
   * When no change of the signal it means it is binary 0 .
   adv = More reliable detection of transition rather than level
   disadv = In complex transmission layouts it is easy to lose sense of polarity

NRZ pros and cons
Pros-
* Easy to engineer
* Make good use of bandwidth
Cons -
* DC component (sync loss on long 0s, DC component, and error propagation)
* Lack of synchronization capability

## Alternative mark inversion
     
1. Bipolar-AMI (Alternative Mark Inversion)

   * Alternating the polarity of the signal for each binary 1, While binary 0 is represented by a zero voltage.  
   ``` 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 - 0 +5 -5 0 +5 0 -5 0 +5 -5 ```
   * Easy error detection
   * No net DC component
   * Lower bandwidth
   * No loss of sync for long string of 1s but zeros have the problem
    
2.  Psuedoternary

    * Binary 0s are represented by alternative positive and negative voltages. While binary 1 comes the level is zero


Trade off for Multilevel Binary
   * Not as efficient as NRZ
        - Each signal element only represents one bit
        - Two levels are used to represent 1
        - Requires approx 3dB more signal power for same probability of bit error.

## Biphase

 1. Manchester  

   * Mid of the interval always has a transition  
             - High to Low if data bit is 0  
             - Low to high if data bit is 1
   (Self Synchronizing - The mid of the interval always has a transition so the synchronization never missed)

 2. Differential Manchester

   * Presence or absence of a transition at the start of the bit period determines the bit value.  If there is a transition in the start of the bit interval the bit is 0.
   * Mid of the interval always have a transition it is for clocking only.
   * No transition at the start of a bit period represents one.

Trade off of Bipase
     Con:
          * Requires more bandwidth (Number of Signal changes is high)
          * At least one transition per bit time and possibly two
          * Maximum modulation rate is twice NRZ
     Pros:
          * Synchronization on mid bit transition (self clocking)
          * No DC component
          * Error detection  


## Scrambling  
``` 
     Scrambling is a technique that replaces long sequences of 0s with predefined patterns to maintain synchronization and eliminate DC components, without adding extra bits.
* Filling sequence
‚Äî Must produce enough transitions to sync
‚Äî Must be recognized by receiver and replace with original
‚Äî Same length as original
‚Ä¢ No dc component
‚Ä¢ No long sequences of zero level line signal
‚Ä¢ No reduction in data rate
‚Ä¢ Error detection capability
     NRZ (L or I) ‚Üí Needs scrambling (or some other technique) because long runs of 0s (or no transitions) cause synchronization loss and a strong DC component.
     
     Manchester (and Differential Manchester) ‚Üí Does not need scrambling, since every bit has a transition in the middle, which guarantees synchronization and avoids DC bias.
```
## AMI-based scrambling methods to handle long zeros.

### B8ZS ‚Üí 8 zeros, HDB3 ‚Üí 4 zeros.

1. B8ZS (Bipolar with 8-Zero Substitution)
     ```
     Used mainly in North America (T1 lines).
     Problem it solves: AMI cannot handle 8 consecutive 0s ‚Üí causes loss of synchronization.
     Solution: Replace 8 consecutive zeros with a special pattern containing two bipolar violations.
     Example substitution: 00000000 ‚Üí 000VB0VB
     V = violation (same polarity as previous 1)
     B = normal bipolar pulse
     ```
2. HDB3 (High-Density Bipolar 3-Zero)
     ```
     Used mainly in Europe (E1 lines).
     Problem it solves: AMI cannot handle 4 consecutive zeros.
     Solution: Replace 4 consecutive zeros with a pattern 000V or B00V depending on number of previous ones to maintain bipolar rules.
     Ensures sufficient transitions for clock recovery.
     ```
