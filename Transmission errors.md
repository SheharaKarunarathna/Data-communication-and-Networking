In OSI model transmission errors are detected and controlled in Data link layer and Transport layer.  
Also in Internet it is done in Network layer.  

# Noise and Errors

## White noise
* Thermal or Gaussian noise. 
* Relatively constant and can be reduced.
* If it gets too strong it can completely disrupt the signal. 

## Impulse noise 
-  One of the most disruptive forms of noise.
-  Difficult to remove from an analog signal because it may be hard to separate from the original signal.
-  When our signal is in faster frequency this affects it more.

## Crosstalk

- Unwanted coupling between two different signal paths.
- For example hearing another conversation while talking on the telephone.
- Relatively constant and can be reduced with proper measures.


## Echo

- Echo occurs when a transmitted signal is reflected back toward the sender after some delay.
- In communication systems (especially telephony), this sounds like hearing your own voice after a short delay.
- Most often occurs on caxial cable.
- If echo bad enough, it could interfere with original signal

## Jitter

- The result of small timing irregularities during the transmission of digital signals.
- Occurs when a digital signal is repeated over and over.
- Solution = Shielder

## Delay Distortion

- Occurs because the velocity of propagation of a signal through a medium varies with the frequency of the signal. Can be reduced using equalizers

## Attenuation
The continuous loss of a signalâ€™s strength as it travels through a medium.
* Use less lossy medium
* Use amplifiers


# How to prevent from transmission errors . 
- Proper shielding of cables to reduce interference
- Telephone line conditioning or equalization
- Replacing older media and equipment with new, possibly digital components
- Proper use of digital repeaters and analog amplifiers
- Observe the stated capacities of the media
